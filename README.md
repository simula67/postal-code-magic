## Overview

Postal Code Magic is an enchanting journey into the world of postal codes.

## What are Postal Codes?

Postal codes, also known as ZIP codes in the United States, are a series of letters or numbers included in postal addresses to facilitate the sorting and delivery of mail. They help postal services route mail to the correct geographic area, city, or even down to a specific street or building.

### Structure of Postal Codes

- **United States (ZIP Code):** Typically consists of 5 digits (e.g., `90210`), but can include an additional 4 digits for more precise location (`90210-1234`).
  - First digit: National area.
  - Next two digits: Regional distribution center.
  - Last two digits: Delivery area within the center.

- **United Kingdom (Postcode):** A combination of letters and numbers (e.g., `SW1A 1AA`).
  - The outward code (e.g., `SW1A`) indicates the postal town or area.
  - The inward code (e.g., `1AA`) narrows it down to a street or a group of addresses.

- **Canada (Postal Code):** Composed of 6 alphanumeric characters (e.g., `M5W 1E6`).
  - Format: `ANA NAN`, where 'A' is a letter and 'N' is a number.
  - First three characters specify a broad area, while the last three provide more precision.

- **Australia (Postcode):** 4 digits (e.g., `2000`), where the first number often indicates the state.

- **Germany (Postleitzahl):** 5 digits (e.g., `10115`).
  - The first two digits indicate the general area, with the last three specifying a more precise location.

Each country has its own system, tailored to its geography, population distribution, and postal service infrastructure.
